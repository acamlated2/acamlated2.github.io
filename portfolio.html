            <p>Project ZipZap is a single-player, isometric, movement focused game where the player uses different
                dash abilities to fight groups of enemies, and to traverse the environment, with the ability to chain
                different dashes together to cause unique interactions.</p>
            <p>This game is made as a university project with 10 other people, collaborating together as a studio to
                create a full, ready to release game within the time span of one year.</p>
            <p>We decided to split the task by their aspects from the game, and assign each person to an aspect of the
                game. This allows each of us to fully understand an aspect of the game and reduce the time of trying to
                understand someone else's work for the task assigned to us.</p>
            <h4>Role</h4>
            <p>In this project, I mainly took the lead on designing and implementing the enemy encounters. This included:</p>
            <h6>Enemy Design</h6>
            <p>- Created variety of enemy types, each with unique behaviours. <br>
                - Defined enemy stats and abilities, while ensuring a balanced and engaging challenge for players. <br>
                - Managed and made sure that all enemies, both in visual and technical design fits within the theme of the game. <br>
                - Designed the AI of each enemy that adapts with changes of conditions in the arena. Giving the enemies interaction between each other.</p>
            <h6>Arena Design</h6>
            <p>- Created an arena template that can easily be used to turn parts of the levels designed by the level design team to a working arena. <br>
                - Placed enemies and consumables strategically within levels to create a sense of progression and challenge. <br>
                - Considered factors like level flow, player visibility, and cover when designing enemy placements.</p>
            <h6>Impact & Achievements</h6>
            <p>Some accomplishment I've achieved with the systems I've implemented according to our playtests: <br>
                - Increased player engagement by balancing arenas, keeping game flow, and controlling arena difficulty level. <br>
                - Improved player's retention by creating a satisfying challenge curve. Shown by player's willingness to keep trying when they failed a level multiple times. <br>
                - Created enemy types that are memorable and easily distinguishable from each other.</p>

            <p>Laze is a 2D reverse bullet hell game where the player gets punished by doing actions, forcing them to
                strategise their actions and behaviours differently.</p>
            <p>This project is in part of my dissertation project in university, of proposing a way to help jump start
                the development process of enemy AIs in Unity. The project includes a template of a base enemy prefab,
                a behaviour tree to help visualise the AI's behaviour flow, and object pools to help reduce the load of
                spawning and despawning enemies.</p>
            <h4>Enemies</h4>
            <p>Examples of enemies made with the system:<br>
                <b>- Normal Melee Enemy</b><br>
                Serving as the most basic enemy type, this type of enemy chases the player and deals damage in melee range. <br>
                <b>- Ranged Enemy</b><br>
                The ranged enemy shoots projectiles to make up for the normal enemy's lack of range. The enemy would
                keep at a distance from the player, forcing the player to use different strategy to fight against them. <br>
                <b>- Shielded Enemy</b><br>
                Having a big shield that rotates around them, the shielded enemies stand in the front lines and protect
                other enemies from ranged attacks. When their shield is broken, they will chase the player and does melee
                attacks. <br>
                <b>- Bomber Enemy</b><br>
                The bomber enemy shoots exploding projectiles from afar, damaging anything in its range. When they run out
                of exploding projectiles, they run towards the player and explode to multiple exploding projectiles.
            </p>
            <h4>Enemy Interactions</h4>
            <p>To make enemies' behaviour less predictable, interactions between enemies are made. The interactions are
                as follows:<br>
                <b> - Ranged & Shielded Enemy Interactions</b><br>
                Shielded enemies will stay within a distance away from the player. Ranged enemies will look for a
                shielded enemy that still has their shield, and stands behind them, hiding from the player. If the
                shielded enemy is defeated, the ranged enemy will look for another shielded enemy.<br>
                <b> - Bomber Enemy Interaction</b>
                As bomber enemy's projectile can damage other enemies, all enemies will try to avoid the projectiles.
                If an exploding projectile gets too close to an enemy, the enemy will calculate a path away from the projectiles.

            <p>Defend is a 3D tower defense game made to showcase how an AI could help players to make
                decisions in the game. In this game, players can press a single button and ask the AI for suggestions.
                The AI will then give suggestions based on various aspects of the game. </p>
            <p>This project is in part of a project in my university, of proposing a way for AI to assist players in a game
                as a sub commander. In this project, the player can request the AI to view of the current state of the game,
                and the AI will give the player suggestions of what actions could benefit the player. </p>
            <p>The player can freely control how the AI behaves by using sliders. Each slider controls one aspect of the
                game the AI use as considerations. </p>
            <h4>AI Considerations</h4>
            <p><b> - Damage Type</b><br>
                The enemies in this game have three types of defensive stats. Each stat can be effectively damaged by a
                specific damage type. When the player asks for the AI's suggestions, the AI will take all the enemies
                currently in the scene, and sum up all their defensive stats. The AI will then suggest a damage type that
                is most suitable to deal damage to the defensive stat tha enemy have most. <br>
                <b>- Platform</b><br>
                In this game, the player can place towers on tiles of varying height. The higher the towers are placed,
                the more range they gain. The AI will see which tile would benefit most by placing a platform, and creates
                a projected price of placing a platform, and a tower. The AI will then compare the projected price and
                check whether it is sensible to buy a platform compared to just buying a tower. <br>
                <b>- Upgrades</b><br>
                Each tower can be upgraded to increase any of their damage type. The AI will take the suggested damage type
                and creates a projected price of buying an upgrade. It will then decide whether to buy an upgrade by
                comparing the projected price to buying a new tower. <br>
                <b>- Tower Placement</b><br>
                If all the other considerations fail, the AI then knows that buying a new tower is the best option. The AI
                then checks all tiles on the map, and finds the best tile to place a tower on based on its coverage of
                the map.

            <p>Medea is a VR game based on the classical play "Medea". In this game, the player becomes
                a godly being and interacts with the scene to help get Medea towards a designated location and progress
                through the story. </p>
            <p>This project is in part of a project in my university, of proposing a way to use games technologies to
                help enhance the delivery of a classical play. In this game, the player can interact with objects scattered
                around the scene to lead Medea towards the designated point. Several decisions are made to make the player feel
                as if they are a god, such as the camera positions, and the interactions the player can do. </p>
            <p>This project uses VR to enhance the immersiveness of the story being told. Players can interact with objects
                in the environment, making them feel more as if they are actually in the scene with the characters. </p>
            <h4>Gameplay</h4>
            <p><b> - Pebbles</b><br>
                Players can pick up pebbles and throw them. If Medea can see the pebble hitting the ground, Medea will
                approach the pebble. After a set amount of time, Medea will go back to the latest checkpoint. <br>
                <b> - Vases</b><br>
                The vases can be pulled towards the player using the player's controller movement, similar to how
                <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> pulls object towards the player. As the vase hits the ground, the vase will make
                a sound that attracts Medea towards its position. <br>

            <p>Messy Theater is a local multiplayer game where players have to make a king laugh by interacting with each
                other or objects in the scene. </p>
            <p>This project was made with a 4-person team for the 2024 Global Game Jam. In the project, my role was to
                make and spawn the objects players could interact with.</p>
            <p>In this game, players can interact with each other by picking objects or each other, and throwing them. They
                can also interact with objects in the scene like the cannon. </p>
            <h4>Objects</h4>
            <p><b> - Tomatoes</b><br>
                Every so often, tomatoes will get thrown towards the players. If a player gets hit by the tomatoes, the
                laugh meter will fill up. Every time a tomato spawns, there is chance for it to be an exploding tomato,
                throwing objects around on impact and filling the laugh meter for an extra amount. <br>
                <b> - Hammer</b><br>
                Every set amount of time, a swinging hammer will be lowered from the ceiling. If a player gets hit by the
                hammer, they will be thrown across the room, filling the laugh meter. <br>
                <b> - Blocks</b><br>
                Every couple of seconds, there is a chance for the ground to shoot upwards, throwing players in the air,
                and filling the laugh meter. <br>

            <p>Jump is a 2D platformer game where players have to jump up platforms as high as they can while avoiding enemies.</p>
            <p>Made in C++ using SFML, this game was made for a university project. In this game, players can climb platforms
                where some of them are occupied by enemies. They can also be filled with health items to help players to
                traverse through the platforms. </p>
            <p>In this game, players can interact with each other by picking objects or each other, and throwing them. They
                can also interact with objects in the scene like the cannon. </p>
            <h4>Objects in the Game</h4>
            <p><b> - Platforms</b><br>
                Taking inspirations from <i>Doodle jump</i>, the platforms in this game are infinitely and randomly generated.
                The platforms are instantiated at the beginning, each spawned at a random position relative to the previous
                platform, preventing the platforms to be unreachable by the player. <br>
                To prevent lag in the game, the game would only instantiate a set amount of platforms. Once the player reaches
                a certain height above the platform, the platform would then be moved towards the top to be a new platform. <br>
                <b> - Enemies</b><br>
                Everytime a platform is reset, there is a chance for it to be spawned with an enemy. If the player touches
                the enemy, they will get hurt. The player can throw projectiles towards the enemy to remove them from the
                platform. <br>
                <b> - Hearts</b><br>
                When a platform is reset, there is also a chance for it to have a heart on it. Hearts heal the player by
                one health. <br>

            <p>In this game, players can choose between which maps to play on, and try to clear the map by collecting the

            <p><b> - Grid</b><br>
                The map is made using a tilemap. Each tile is tagged with the index of its column and row position. The
                type of the tile is then determined by the tilemap and is then used by the player and the ghosts to
                calculate their movements. <br>
                <b> - Ghosts</b><br>
                To traverse through the map, the ghost moves with a semi-random direction. Everytime the ghost enters a
                new tile, it will figure out which direction it can go to by looking at the neighbouring tiles. Using the
                neighbouring tiles information, the ghost moves to a random neighbouring tile. The ghost cannot move

            <p><b> - Stuns & Boosts</b><br>
                The players and the AI can shoot projectiles at each other. If any of the paddles are hit by a projectile,
                the paddle is stunned for a set amount of time. To prevent the projectiles from being too overpowered,
                a boost system was implemented. The players or the AI can increase the speed of their paddle for a short
                amount of time. Boosting takes up energy and if the energy runs out, they have to wait until their energy
                is recharged. The energy of each paddle recharges over time. <br>
                <b> - AI</b><br>
                This game offers multiple difficulties of the AI. The difficulty changes the AI's movement calculation
                speed, targeting accuracy, and ability to use boosts. As the difficulty increases, the AI have increased
                calculation speed, increased accuracy, and more likely to use boosts. <br>

            <p>Race is a project to compare Unreal Engine 5 and Unity from the development perspective.
                This project compares the ease of use of each engine, how each engine handles objects in the game, and
                to find my personal preference between the two. </p>
            <p>In this project, I made a simple racing game in each of the engine. Both game would have a car the player
                can control and multiple checkpoints to guide the player through the racetrack. The checkpoints need to be
                able to be easily duplicated to and destroyed to increase and decrease the length of the racetrack. </p>
            <p>The project achieves similar level of completeness in both engines. However, differences were
                found between the two engines. Unity doesn't have a racing game template therefore i have to implement my own
                car, taking up some development time. Unity uses a hierarchical system in their scene management which i prefer
                since i can get multiple objects that are a child of a parent object easily rather than referring to each object
                each time like in Unreal Engine. However, i found that the collision detection in Unreal engine is much more
                reliable than it is in Unity. I found myself not colliding with my checkpoints a lot in Unity. </p>
            <p>In the end, i prefer Unity more than Unreal Engine. Its hierarchical scene management is a good enough
                trade off for me to choose it over Unreal Engine for now. </p>

            <p>This project was part of a university group project where we developed a game based on the movie <i>Shutter

                moves semi-randomly and the escapee would have to try to mimic their movement patterns to blend in with the NPCs
                and hide from the guard. The AI will detect when it reaches a new tile, and looks where it can move on that tile
                excluding backwards. If they can move in more than one direction they will pick a random direction. If they
                reached a dead end, they will then move backwards. </p>

        <div class="w3-container">
            <p>Budget Tracker Assistant is a personal project of mine where i make a program to reduce
                the repetitiveness of my budget tracking activity. Everytime I spend money on something, I note it down
                on a <i>Google Sheets</i> document. This helps me analyse my spending which helps me better plan my future
                spending. This project is made to reduce the time doing my budget tracking by automating some of the repetitive
                parts. </p>
            <p>Made using <i>Google's AppScript</i>, this project automates two tasks, creating a new sheet each month,
                and to check calendar events. If the program fails to execute any of the tasks, it will email me, notifying
                me of the problem. </p>
            <p><b> - New Sheet</b><br>
                On the first day of each month, the program will create a new sheet for me to track my budgets. The program
                will duplicate a template, name it using the month and year, and place it in the correct sorting order. The
                program will then fill out the new sheet with the appropriate data taken from the previous month's sheet. <br>
                <b> - Subscriptions</b><br>
                As I subscribed to multiple services, I have to track the subscriptions' payment at the same time each month.
                To automate this, I note my subscriptions on my <i>Google Calendar</i>. Everyday, the program looks up my
                calendar and checks if there is an event which name has a specific format. If there is, the program will
                take the data from the calendar, and try to put it in the current month's sheet. The program will look up
                for an empty row in the sheet, and put all the data on the empty row. <br>
