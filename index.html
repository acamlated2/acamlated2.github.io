                    <h5 class="acamlatedMarginLeft">Description</h5>
                    <p>
                        Project ZipZap is a single-player, isometric, movement focused video game where the player uses
                        different dash abilities to fight groups of enemies, and to traverse the environment, with the
                        ability to chain different dashes together to cause unique interactions.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="acamlatedMarginLeft">Details</h5>
                    <p>
                        This game is made as a university project with 10 other people, collaborating together as a
                        studio to create a full, ready to release game within the time span of one year.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We decided to split the task by their aspects from the game, and assign each person to an aspect
                        of the game. This allows each of us to fully understand an aspect of the game and reduce the
                        time of trying to understand someone else's work for the task assigned to us.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="acamlatedMarginLeft">Role - Enemies</h5>
                    <p>
                        In this project, I mainly took the lead on designing and implementing the enemy encounters. This included:
                    </p>
                    <h6 class="acamlatedMarginLeft">Enemy Design</h6>
                    <p>
                         - Created variety of enemy types, each with unique behaviours.
                        <br>
                         - Defined enemy stats and abilities, while ensuring a balanced and engaging challenge for players.
                        <br>
                         - Managed and made sure that all enemies, both in visual and technical design fits within the
                        theme of the game.
                    </p>
                    <h6 class="acamlatedMarginLeft">Arena Design</h6>
                    <p>
                         - Created an arena template that can easily be used to turn parts of the levels designed by the
                        level design team to a working arena.
                        <br>
                         - Placed enemies and consumables strategically within levels to create a sense of progression
                        and challenge.
                        <br>
                         - Considered factors like level flow, player visibility, and cover when designing enemy placements.
                    </p>
                    <h6 class="acamlatedMarginLeft">System Implementation</h6>
                    <p>
                        - Designed the AI of each enemy that adapts with changes of conditions in the arena. Giving the
                        enemies interaction between each other.
                    </p>
                    <h6 class="acamlatedMarginLeft">Impact & Achievements</h6>
                    <p>
                        Some accomplishment I've achieved with the systems I've implemented according to our playtests:
                        <br>
                        - Increased player engagement by balancing arenas, keeping game flow, and controlling arena
                        difficulty level.
                        <br>
                         - Improved player's retention by creating a satisfying challenge curve. Shown by player's
                        willingness to keep trying when they failed a level multiple times.
                        <br>
                         - Created enemy types that are memorable and easily distinguishable from each other.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Laze is a 2D reverse bullet hell game where the player gets punished by doing actions, forcing
                        them to strategise their actions and behaviours differently.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="acamlatedMarginLeft">Details</h5>
                    <p>
                        This project is in part of my dissertation project in university, of proposing a way to help jump
                        start the development process of enemy AIs in Unity. The project includes a template of a base
                        enemy prefab, a behaviour tree to help visualise the AI's behaviour flow, and object pools to
                        help reduce the load of spawning and despawning enemies.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="acamlatedMarginLeft">Enemies</h5>
                    <p>
                        Examples of enemies made with the system:
                        <br>
                        <h6 class="acamlatedMarginLeft"> - Normal Melee Enemy</h6>
                        Only chasing and attacking player with melee attacks, these enemies serves as the most basic enemy type.
                        <br>
                        <h6 class="acamlatedMarginLeft"> - Ranged Enemy</h6>
                        Attacks with a shooting projectiles, this enemy type compensates for the normal enemies' lack of range.
                        <br>
                        <h6 class="acamlatedMarginLeft"> - Shielded Enemy</h6>
                        With a shield that tracks the player's position and rotates around them, the shielded enemy protects
                        other enemies by standing between them. If their shield is broken however, they will chase the player
                        like the normal enemies.
                        <br>
                        <h6 class="acamlatedMarginLeft">Bomber Enemy</h6>
                        Shooting exploding projectiles, the bomber enemy compensates for other enemies' lack of AOE damage.
                        If they ran out of bullets or gets defeated, they explode to multiple exploding projectiles.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="acamlatedMarginLeft">Enemy Interactions</h5>
                    <p>
                        To make enemies' behaviour less predictable, interactions between enemies are made. The interactions
                        are as follows:
                        <br>
                        <h6 class="acamlatedMarginLeft">Ranged & Shielded Enemy Interactions</h6>
                        Shielded enemies will stay within a distance away from the player. Ranged enemies will look for
                        a shielded enemy that still has their shield, and stands behind them, hiding from the player. If
                        the shielded enemy is defeated, the ranged enemy will look for another shielded enemy.
                        <br>
                        <h6 class="acamlatedMarginLeft">Bomber Enemy Interaction</h6>
                        As bomber enemy's projectile can damage other enemies, all enemies will try to avoid the projectiles.
                        If an exploding projectile gets too close to an enemy, the enemy will calculate a path away from
                        the projectiles.

                        Made to showcase the possibility of games technology to better immerse users with a classical play,
                        this unnamed project uses VR to retell scenes from the play "Medea".

                    <h5 class="acamlatedMarginLeft">Gameplay</h5>
                    <p>
                        This project uses VR to enhance the impressiveness of the classical play and let users be present
                        in the story. To do so, the project lets users to directly interact with objects in the scene.
                        The objects are as follows:
                        <br>
                         - Pebbles
                        <br>
                        Pebbles can be picked up and thrown, luring Medea towards the designated location lead by the user.
                        <br>
                         - Vases
                        <br>
                        The vases can be pulled towards the player using the player's controller movement, similar to
                        how <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> pulls object towards the player.

                    <p>
                        Messy Theater is a local multiplayer game where players have to make a king laugh by interacting
                        with each other or objects in the scene.

                    <p>
                        This game was made with a 4-person group for the 2024 Global Game Jam. In the project, my role
                        was to make and spawn the objects players could interact with. The objects include:
                    </p>
                    <h6 class="acamlatedMarginLeft"> - Tomatoes</h6>
                    <p>
                        Every so often, tomatoes will get thrown towards the players. If a player gets hit by the tomatoes,
                        the laugh meter will fill up. Every time a tomato spawns, there is chance for it to be an exploding
                        tomato, throwing objects around on impact.
                    </p>
                    <h6 class="acamlatedMarginLeft"> - Hammer</h6>
                    <p>
                        Every set amount of time, a swinging hammer will be lowered from the ceiling. If a player gets hit
                        by the hammer, the laugh meter would fill.
                    </p>
                    <h6 class="acamlatedMarginLeft"> - Blocks</h6>
                    <p>
                        Every set amount of time, the ground where players stand on will shoot up, throwing players on top
                        and on to the side of it. If a player gets thrown, the laugh meter fills up.

                        Made as a university project, this project shows how an AI can be used to help players in a tower

                    <h5 class="acamlatedMarginLeft">AI</h5>
                    <p>
                        In this project, players can press a button and request the AI for suggestions. The AI takes in
                        these considerations:
                    </p>
                    <h6 class="acamlatedMarginLeft"> - Tower Type</h6>
                    <p>
                        The AI looks for enemies in the scene, and sums up all their different stats. The AI then uses that
                        to decide which tower type is currently the most suitable to buy.
                    </p>
                    <h6 class="acamlatedMarginLeft"> - Platform</h6>
                    <p>
                        The AI checks if buying a platform is better than buying a tower. A platform can be placed on a
                        block to increase its height, increasing the range of towers placed on top of it. The AI calculates
                        the projected price of towers compared to using the platform to decide.
                    </p>
                    <h6 class="acamlatedMarginLeft"> - Upgrades</h6>
                    <p>
                        If buying a platform isn't viable, the AI checks if buying an upgrade will. The AI takes in the
                        needed damage type, finds the cheapest tower to upgrade. The AI checks to buy an upgrade by
                        comparing the projected price of buying an upgrade to the price of a brand new tower.
                    </p>
                    <h6 class="acamlatedMarginLeft"> - Tower Placement</h6>
                    <p>
                        if all other checks failed, then the AI knows to suggest to buy a new tower. The AI checks every
                        ground block in the scene, and see which one has the best coverage if a tower is placed on top of
                        it.
